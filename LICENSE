PROJECT LICENSE & POLICIES
AloneMusic — LICENSE (Comprehensive Edition)
------------------------------------------------------------
Preamble
------------------------------------------------------------
This file combines a permissive software license (MIT) with
project-level guidelines, contribution rules, and a Code of Conduct.
The purpose is to give users and contributors clear, friendly,
and detailed guidance while keeping the software freely usable.

You are free to use, modify and redistribute the code under the
terms of the permissive MIT license below. In addition, this file
contains recommended project behavior (contributions, attribution,
and conduct) which contributors are asked to follow to keep the
project healthy and welcoming.

If you need a different legal license (e.g., Apache 2.0, GPLv3),
please choose one and replace the MIT section below with the
official text of that license. The non-legal guidelines and the
Code of Conduct can remain alongside any chosen license.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Source code may be copied, modified, merged, published, and redistributed.
3. You may use the code in proprietary or open-source products.

------------------------------------------------------------
Contributions & Contributor Rights
------------------------------------------------------------
1. By submitting a pull request, patch, or any other contribution,
   you agree to grant the project maintainers a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify,
   and redistribute your contribution under the same license as the project.
2. Please ensure contributions follow the project's coding style and
   testing guidelines. Add tests where applicable and include short
   explanation in the PR description.
3. If you want to contribute under different terms, contact the maintainers
   explicitly and obtain written agreement before submitting.

------------------------------------------------------------
Intellectual Property / Patents
------------------------------------------------------------
- This project disclaims patent rights to the extent permitted by law.
- Contributors warrant (to the best of their knowledge) that they have
  the right to contribute the changes they propose and that those changes
  do not infringe third-party rights.

------------------------------------------------------------
Project Governance & Release Policy
------------------------------------------------------------
- The repository maintainers control the mainline and release tags.
- Major changes may require consensus or a public RFC/issue discussion.
- Security fixes should be coordinated via private channels if sensitive,
  and disclose responsibly once an update is available.

------------------------------------------------------------
Code of Conduct (Short)
------------------------------------------------------------
We want everyone to feel welcome and safe contributing. By participating
in this project you agree to abide by the following:

1. Be respectful. Treat everyone with courtesy and respect.
2. No harassment, abusive language, or hateful content.
3. Keep discussions constructive: focus on technical issues, not people.
4. If you have a dispute, escalate it to maintainers rather than dragging it
   into public threads.
5. Maintain confidentiality for private security discussions.

If you see violations, report them to the maintainers (create a private issue
or contact the maintainers via the project channel).

------------------------------------------------------------
Contribution Workflow (recommended)
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a descriptive topic branch: `feature/name` or `fix/issue-number`.
3. Add tests and documentation for your change.
4. Run linting and tests locally before opening a PR.
5. Create a Pull Request with clear description, changelog, and test steps.
6. Be responsive to review comments — maintainers may request changes.
7. Squash or rebase commits if requested for a clean history.
